# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! My name is Daniel Nelson and I'm a self-taught front-end web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and user-friendly websites. I thrive on the endless possibilities that programming offers and I'm constantly fueled by my enthusiasm to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.

With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I love bringing designs to life and crafting engaging user experiences. I've also dived into frameworks like React JS, which has expanded my toolkit and allowed me to build dynamic and interactive web applications.

One of my favorite aspects of programming is problem-solving. I approach each challenge with determination and curiosity, always seeking efficient and elegant solutions. I'm a big advocate for clean code and strive to write maintainable and scalable applications.

Constantly pushing the boundaries of my knowledge, I stay up to date with the latest industry trends and technologies. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and actively seek opportunities to enhance my skills.

My goal is to forge a long-lasting career in computer science, leveraging my self-taught expertise and passion for programming. I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and make a meaningful impact in the world of web development.

Let's build something amazing together!
